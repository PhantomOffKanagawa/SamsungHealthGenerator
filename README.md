# SamsungHealthGenerator
A generator to create fake "Other Workouts" for Samsung Health as to provide proof for my legitimate and definitely completed exercises

Generates data for heartrate based on averages of my metrics and then randomizes based on  [noise.js](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs) then displays that data with [canvas.js](https://canvasjs.com/)

### ToDo
 - [ ] Cleanup and comment code
 - [ ] Add controls for time and date
 - [ ] Add controls for heart rate and intensity
 - [ ] Improved background bs for creating graph
 - [ ] Possibly condense into a one button action
